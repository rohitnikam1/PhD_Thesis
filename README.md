# PhD Thesis: Highly charged dendritic polyelectrolytes: Competitive ion binding and charge renormalization

Polyelectrolytes (PEs) represent a broad and interesting class of materials that are getting 
an increasing attention in the scientific community. Quintessential roles of PEs range from 
the information encapsulators (DNA, RNA) to the architects of cellular life (proteins) in 
biological world and from the superabsorbers to the drug delivery agents in the artificial 
world. However, despite extensive theoretical and experimental research, the understanding 
of PE solutions has been relatively poor compared to their neutral counterparts. The 
main dif i culty in their theoretical treatment arises from the long-range nature of electrostatic 
interactions between the charged groups and ions, which becomes more prominent 
issue for highly charged PEs, and puts forth challenges towards the theoretical rationalization 
of the subsequent counterion condensation and charge renormalization. Moreover, 
the counter-intuitive footprint of PE–water thermodynamics, and the simultaneous presence 
of the divalent and the monovalent counterions in the solution, as is reminiscent of 
many biological environments, escalates the complexity and richness of the problem. This 
affects the subsequent complexations of the PE with other biologically relevant molecules 
such as proteins, and thus the functions, applications of such complexes in biomedicine 
and biotechnology. 

In this thesis, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the charge and hydration 
structure of dendritic PEs in a monovalent salt using all-atom explicit-water molecular 
dynamics (MD) computer simulations and semi-analytical theoretical approaches, and 
investigated a competitive sorption of mono-versus divalent ions on globular PEs using 
mean-field theoretical models, all-atom and coarse-grained (CG) simulations and calorimetry 
experiments. Atomic specificity and explicit treatment of water in MD simulations 
allows us to characterize the PE by calculating molecular distributions and to rationalize 
the energetics of PE–water interaction. In particular, owing to the charged renormalization 
of the PE induced by condensed counterions, we address the challenges of how to 
obtain a well-defined effective charge and surface potential of the PE for practical 
applications using the implicit- and explicit-solvent approaches. We present a novel two-state 
binding model as an extension of one component conventional Langmuir binding model, 
to study the competitive ion sorption, ensuring a meaningful comparison between theory, 
simulations and experiments.

This thesis lays out a systematic methodological demonstration of the PE electrostatic 
characterization, explores PE–water thermodynamic signature, and shows a comprehensive 
analysis of the competitive binding of divalent and monovalent counterions on the PE. 
The theoretical and simulation analysis provides a deeper insight into the physicochemical 
aspects of PE–counterion and PE–water interactions on the atomistic and mesoscopic 
level, which has a potential to contribute in propelling a new perspective for the rational 
design of PEs on a targeted application basis.
